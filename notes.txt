Lessons Learned from Event Management API Task


1. Project Structure and Organization

Implemented a clean, modular folder structure (config, middleware, models, routes, utils) for maintainability.

Learned the importance of separating concerns (e.g., database logic in models, route handling in routes).

Understood the value of clear commit history and documentation in a GitHub repository.



2. Backend Development with Node.js and Express

Gained experience setting up a RESTful API using Express, including middleware for validation and error handling.

Learned to handle HTTP methods (POST, GET, DELETE) and appropriate status codes (201, 400, 404, 409, 500).

Implemented route-specific middleware for input validation and business logic enforcement.



3.PostgreSQL Database Management

Mastered creating tables with appropriate data types, constraints (e.g., UNIQUE, CHECK), and foreign keys.

Learned to use SERIAL for auto-incrementing IDs and establish many-to-many relationships via a junction table (registrations).

Understood the importance of running SQL schema scripts to set up the database before starting the application.



4. Concurrency and Transaction Management

Implemented database transactions to handle concurrent registrations and cancellations safely.

Learned to use BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK in PostgreSQL to ensure atomic operations.

Understood how to prevent race conditions in high-concurrency scenarios.



5. Business Logic Implementation

Enforced rules like preventing duplicate registrations, limiting event capacity (â‰¤1000), and disallowing past event registrations.

Learned to validate inputs thoroughly (e.g., ISO date format, positive integers) using middleware.

Implemented custom sorting logic (date ascending, location alphabetical) in SQL queries for efficiency.



6. Error Handling and User Experience

Developed a centralized error handling utility to provide consistent, meaningful error messages.

Learned to map errors to appropriate HTTP status codes based on context (e.g., 404 for not found, 409 for conflicts).

Understood the importance of clear error messages for API consumers.



7.Database Query Optimization

Used efficient SQL queries with JOINs and aggregations to fetch event details and stats.

Learned to minimize database calls by combining data retrieval in single queries (e.g., event details with registered users).

Understood the importance of indexing (implied by PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints) for performance.



8. Environment Configuration

Learned to use .env files with dotenv for secure configuration of database credentials and server port.

Understood the importance of keeping sensitive data (e.g., DB_PASSWORD) out of version control via .gitignore.



9. API Testing and Documentation

Gained experience writing clear README documentation with setup instructions and example requests/responses.

Learned to test APIs using curl commands and Postman collections.

Understood the importance of providing example payloads for each endpoint to guide API consumers.



10. Running SQL Commands in PostgreSQL

Mastered multiple methods to execute SQL scripts (psql, SQL files, pgAdmin, DBeaver).

Learned the importance of creating tables in the correct order due to foreign key dependencies.

Understood how to verify table creation and troubleshoot common database errors.



11. Production-Level Considerations

Recognized the need for additional features in production, such as authentication, rate limiting, pagination, and logging.

Learned the importance of comprehensive input validation and error handling for robust APIs.

Understood the value of transactions for maintaining data integrity in concurrent scenarios.



12. Development Workflow

Learned to set up a Node.js project with dependencies (express, pg, dotenv) and devDependencies (nodemon).

Gained experience using npm scripts (npm start, npm run dev) for running the application.

Understood the importance of testing APIs locally before deployment.




This task provided hands-on experience in building a production-ready REST API, managing a relational database, and implementing robust business logic, preparing me for real-world backend development challenges.
